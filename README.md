Project Description:

Monitoring and detection of stink bugs are of great importance for achieving the best possible agricultural quality, public health, environmental protection, and sustainability. The spread of stink bugs has caused a lot of damage in other states and has been recently introduced into Minnesota. We want to monitor and detect stink bugs spread in early stages to prevent the spread across Minnesota. This project is an effort to build a real-time online system for a visualization map to allow users to monitor and detect Brown Marmorated Stink Bug Invasive species spread across Minnesota. Our expected outcomes for successfully delivering are to build a real-time online system that gets the data from MN geospatial commons and store the data in PostGIS databases. SQL language will be used to query the data and import it into ArcPro to generate the map in real-time and prioritize a ranked list of cities based on spread statistics. This helps prioritize a spread ranked list of cities and automates quality assurance and quality control procedures. This project will impact the Minnesota DNR and Department of Agriculture and the person that has been asking for it, Shaul. They will not be design partners.
